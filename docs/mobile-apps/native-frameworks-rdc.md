:::warning Only Available in TestObject

At the moment, the Sauce Runner is only available for our Legacy Real Device Cloud Platform, therefore all topics in this page do not apply to automated testing with Real Devices in Sauce Labs. Check the [Real Device Testing in Sauce Labs Feature Preview](https://sauce-docs.com) for updates on when the Sauce Runner will be available.

Sauce Labs offers the ability to run tests using popular native frameworks such as Espresso and XCUITest against real devices using the Sauce Runner for Real Devices.
