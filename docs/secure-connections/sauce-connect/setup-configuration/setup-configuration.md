## Setup and Configuration
Sauce Labs offers five different Sauce Connect Proxy setup types:
* [Basic Sauce Connect Proxy Setup](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/basic-setup)
* [Sauce Connect Proxy Setup with Additional Proxies](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/additional-proxies)
* [High Availability Sauce Connect Proxy Setup](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/high-availability)
* [Sauce Connect Proxy Setup for Real Device Cloud](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/specialized-environments)
* [Headless Sauce Connect Proxy Setup](/secure-connections/sauce-connect/setup-configuration/specialized-environments)

Sauce Connect must be installed on the same network as the application or website you're testing, however, it is not required to install Sauce Connect on the same local machine. For this reason, when setting up Sauce Connect, be mindful of how Sauce Connect will interact with your network architecture.

As you’re configuring the Sauce Connect Proxy setup type that’s right for you, it's important to understand how the program will interact with your network architecture components (e.g., proxies, firewalls, geographically distributed data centers).
