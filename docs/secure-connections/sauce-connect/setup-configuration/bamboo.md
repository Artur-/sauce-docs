[Atlassian Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) is a continuous integration server that can be used to automate the release management for your software applications, creating a continuous delivery pipeline.

We offer a plug-in that will integrate your Bamboo builds with Sauce Connect for automating functional tests. Installation is an easy one-time admin configuration. From there, you can designate builds to test on your preferred browser/OS combinations.

Here are some of the features:

* Embed Sauce reports: embed Sauce reports within your Bamboo test results
* Configure browser combinations: configure your Bamboo build to specify the browser combinations
* Configure Administration interface: configure user name and password within Administration interface

Note that this plug-in also has a set of environment variables that are specific to Bamboo. Youâ€™ll also need to output the Sauce session ID to the standard output (stdout) to allow the plug-in to associate test results with Sauce jobs.

### Installing and Configuring the Sauce Labs Plugin for Bamboo

**Important Steps for All Continuous Integration Configurations**

When you are configuring your continuous integration platform to work with Sauce, always make sure to follow these steps:

1. Update tests to reference the environment variables set by the plugin. See the topic on Setting Environment Variables for more information.
2. Output the Sauce session ID to the standard output (stdout) to allow the Sauce plugin to associate test results to Sauce Jobs. See the topic on Outputting Session IDs to stdout for more information.
