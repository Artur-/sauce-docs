# Quickstart for Cypress, TestCafe, and Playwright


## Step 1: Install SauceCTL and the TestRunner Toolkit

You can set up the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit along with Docker _or _run SauceCTL on Sauce Labs VMs on your computer MacOS Computer. The basic steps include:

* Install SauceCTL with `npm i -g saucectl`

* Set your Sauce username and access key with `saucectl configure`

* Create a new SauceCTL project with `saucectl new`

* Update `config.yml` with test suite information

See more detailed instructions [in the documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/installation), or see [an example with Cypress ](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-Testrunner/index.html?index=..%2F..testrunner#2)


## Step 2: Run Your Tests

You can run you Cypress, TestCafe, or Playwright test in two different ways:



*   **Docker Mode â€“** Install Docker and run a containerized version of your test environment, then pass the results to the Sauce Labs Dashboard , using the command `saucectl run --test-env docker`
*   **Sauce Mode -** Install SauceCTL then pass your entire test suite, including dependencies and configurations to Sauce Labs Cloud of Virtual Machines, where your tests will be executed as per your configurations. Use the command `saucectl run` or `saucectl run --test-env sauce`, to run your tests on Sauce Labs VMs.

See More about running tests[ in documentation](https://docs.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/running-tests), or see an [example with Cypress](https://training.saucelabs.com/codelabs/Module1-Testrunner/index.html?index=..%2F..testrunner#3).
